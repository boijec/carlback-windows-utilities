# Carlback Utilities
*Windows Command Line Utilities (Born to Penguin, Forced to use glass)*

By: Carl "Callback" Boije

This is a cargo project containing some of my personally developed commandline utilities for Windows that I use in my day-to-day at work (I use Windows BTW). These are mostly re-mixes of programs that come with Linux.

Possibly use if:
* If your empoyer does not trust software like Cmder or Cygwin.
* If you like to check out rust projects.
